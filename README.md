# Python CRUD Application for Healthcare Industry

A comprehensive Python application for managing patient queue data with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

## Business Understanding

This project caters to the healthcare industry, specifically addressing the need to manage patient queue data efficiently. Patient queue plays a crucial role in making sure a hospital's day-to-day operations remain smooth. It also helps in recognizing problems that might arise in the hospital's service, such as certain departments or subspecialties being understaffed, prioritizing patients who paid more in the same queue, etc.

**Benefits:**

* Improved data accuracy and consistency
* Streamlined data management processes
* Enhanced decision-making through readily available data
* ... (List additional benefits relevant to the business)

**Target Users:**

This application is designed for data admins within the organization to facilitate their documentation process related to patient queue.

## Features

* **Create:**
    * Add new patient queue entries with essential details like waiting time.
    * Implement validation rules to ensure data integrity (if applicable, e.g., unique identifiers, data type checks).
* **Read:**
    * Search and retrieve specific patient queue records by applying filters based on patient ID.
    * Display comprehensive information for each patient queue in a user-friendly format.
    * Integrate pagination and sorting capabilities for large datasets (if applicable).
* **Update:**
    * Modify existing patient queue data to reflect changes in the patient's waiting time, exam time, care time, and/or insurance payment.
    * Provide clear confirmation or error messages based on update success or failure.
* **Delete:**
    * Allow for the removal of unwanted patient queue records with appropriate authorization checks (if applicable).
    * Implement soft delete functionality to prevent permanent data loss (optional, depending on business needs).
    * Consider offering data archiving capabilities (optional).
* **Security:**
    * Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms (if sensitive data is involved) to control access to different CRUD operations.
    * ... (Specify additional security features as needed)
* **Reporting:**
    * Generate reports or summaries based on patient queue data to support hospital operations (optional).
    * Export data in various formats (e.g., CSV, Excel) for further analysis (optional).

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * Python version (specify the required version)
    * Additional dependencies (list any required packages)

2. **Installation:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
    cd <your-repo-name>

## Usage

1. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. **CRUD Operations:**
    * **Create:** Add a new [Data Entity] record, for example, a new customer in a customer management system, providing details like name, contact information, and preferences.
    * **Read:** Search and retrieve customer information by name, ID, or other relevant criteria.
    * **Update:** Modify customer details, such as updating their address or contact details.
    * **Delete:** Remove a customer record from the system (with appropriate authorization, if applicable).

## Data Model
This project utilizes a [Data Structure] (e.g., relational database, JSON documents) to represent [Data Entity] data. The following fields are typically stored:
   * [Field 1]: (Data type) - Description of the field's purpose in the business context.
   * [Field 2]: (Data type) - Description of the field's purpose in the business context.
   * ... (List all relevant fields)
